Before we started on any of our Phase 2 build plans, we needed a good working area to complete the various components and a place to store all of the tools we had been accumulating.

Therefore, the first order of business was to build a good work bench and storage system for the garage. We found our design [online from a lady in Alaska](https://www.ana-white.com/woodworking-projects/ultimate-roll-away-workbench-miter-saw-stand) and then got to work.

First I built the bench system that would hold the miter saw and allow for long pieces to be cut.

Then the more involved step was building out the rolling cabinets that would allow for storage of tools.

One of the carts holds the table saw in a recessed position and the two carts can be placed together to allow for larger pieces of plywood to be ripped on the table saw.

Finally, the two carts can roll under the upper bench system, allowing everything to be tucked away nicely. This bench holds all of our woodworking (and many other) tools and is an excellent platform for building.
