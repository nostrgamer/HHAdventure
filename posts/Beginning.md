My wife and I have been dreaming of building a van for the last 10 years. Partially a dream of adventure, partially a dream of building something extremely challenging (as van builds tend to be). For years we've also been talking with our son about future van travels and he is now excited to get on the road as well.

In the winter of 2024, we purchased our van and began the build.
