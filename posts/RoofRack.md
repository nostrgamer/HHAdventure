With the work bench built, Phase 2 could get officially underway. First order of business was to build a custom roof rack. Last year we looked at buying easy to assemble racks for our Ford Transit and the price point was nearly $1,800. Now that I had plenty of time, I could build my own that would serve our needs at a fraction of the price.

I had seen a few other builders use electrical strut also known as uni-strut for their build, plus a bit of creativity. Armed with a few sketches, the size of our previously purchased 175W solar panels and the cold January weather to motivate me to work quickly, off I went (to Home Depot).

Fortunately, the Transit vans come with built in roof-rack hard points that thread into the van with M8 bolts and are covered with a small plastic cover. A bit of use of the heat gun and some elbow grease revealed the hard points.

Alas, in typical Ford fashion, nothing is done exactly right and several of the hard points (meaning 6 of the 8) were misaligned. Fortunately, nothing a dremel and some grinding couldn't fix.

Feeling satisifed but having accomplished nothing more than drilling out some holes in our van and some painted uni-strut, I went back to Home Depot (after failing to purchase the correct hardware on Amazon).

Several more trips to Home Depot (having missed certain pieces or gotten the wrong thing), I finally had a working mount that we could use to attach the Uni-strut to the van (this system was based on a UK build I found).

Once I was satisifed the side rails would work, it was time to cut and dry fit the crosswise racks that the solar would mount to.

Now that I'd scuffed up a good bit of the side rails and racks, I had to do a bunch of touch up painting. Additionally, I needed to paint the rest of the zinc hardware like the washers and plates so they wouldn't discolor when in contact with the other metals.

The final step for the rack was to complete the installation of the mounting hardware using a bit of Sika Flex adhesive to seal everything together. Sika Flex is very sticky, so this did a bit of doing (plus some liberal use of rubbing alcohol).
