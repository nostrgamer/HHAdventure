We had a camping trip planned for early June, so with the clock ticking, we put together the final essentials for the van at this point, which included bug nets, a topper for my son's bed when the bench was down, a water pump, and some stick on LED lighting. We had our Goal Zero yeti for basic power (although no solar or other power source, so we would be reliant on the charge we could carry).

Mrs. H again coming in to save the day with a jerry can water and grey water solution that fit our timing and budget.

And with those final items, we were ready to camp.
