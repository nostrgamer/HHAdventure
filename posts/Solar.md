While installing the roof rack was a good start, the main purpose of putting things on the roof was to install solar panels so that we could have a power source for our van. 

The first step was to pull out the solar panels we'd found on deep discount during Cyber Monday and make sure they actually worked.

With the reassurance that the panels were working, I set out to do a bit more dry fitting.

Then installing the panels themselves. All the bolts were installed using removable thread locker to ensure that they wouldn't accidentially come loose while driving. Additionally, I had to check several times to make sure I had sufficient clearance for the panels from the roof.

Powering up the solar involved using two branch splitters to run positive to positive and negative to negative (parallel) into a single MC4 connector that would go into the van and connect to our Goal Zero Yeti.

Then drilling a hole in the van, I installed the solar flange cover, ensured gaps were filled with butyl tape, fished the wires through (covering the wires with butyl tape to ensure no metal contact with the van could cut the wires), and sealed everything up with more Sika Flex.

Once I get to the full electrical install, the wiring which is just running down the side of the van will be fed through the walls and covered up. But for now, we have power!
