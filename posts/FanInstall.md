We were so close at this point to having a van we could do basic camping in; however, adding some ventilation was required first. So we got ready to proceed with the next scary thing - cutting giant holes in the van roof.

Fortunately, DIY Vans makes a great kit that makes the installation a lot easier, including foam frames that help you size the cut and make sure you aren't going to end up with a leaky roof.

Once the cutting began with the jigsaw, we were committed.

Next up was figuring out the rest of the installation.

Putting the frames together requires a heavy duty silicon adhesive called Sikaflex. Installing this with a manual caulk gun is an arm buster. After one day, I broke down and bought a powered caulk gun, the MVP of this build. It has subsequently come in handy for several other projects.

And here is the finished product.
