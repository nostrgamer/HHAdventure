description: "Installing the Bench Seat which folds out into a Bed"

We were making excellent progress as the sun came out in March. Next up was one of the critical parts of the build, because it required the first permanent drilling in the van. However, installation of this Scopema Bench which folds down into a bed, was a critical part of the build, since so much would be built around it and because it was the first step to making the van fully habitable, meaning it would allow all of us to sit in the vehicle while moving, while also providing the first bed in the van. I was very nervous but excited for this next step.

These three pictures don't really do justice to the tetris that is needed to fit the bench. There is a reason that Scopema recommends that this is done professionally. You must allow for enough space for easy passage in the van, allow for enough room for the seatbelt to work against the wall, and the seat must be positioned in the van so it is the right distance to allow use of the driver's seat to swivel and make the full bed. Did I mention that the underside of the van is full of extremely important mechanical parts that also have to be avoided? And there are 7 bolts to deploy. Despite this, I was undeterred.

Eventually after many hours of trying to get a viable set of pilot holes, I called in the design team and brains of the project. Mrs. H hand drafted this design (with me providing measurements from the underside) so we could find a precise fit. No, my wife is not an engineer, but yes I think she would have done well at it. She was the MVP for this part of the van build. And no, you can't find this on the internet. Nothing to see here Ford.

With this very helpful tool in place, it did not take long to get everything fit correctly and bolted in, whew!

While this was a stressful installation, after this part was completed, this added huge momentum to our build.
