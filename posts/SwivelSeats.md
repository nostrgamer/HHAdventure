Before we can build other components into the rest of the van, installing swivel seats for the driver and passenger side will allow us to further design the rest of the van.

The passenger side is quite straight forward, utilizing heavy duty bearing swivels from the French company, Scopema.

The less easy part of the installation is the driver's side for vehicles like ours that still feature the handle bar emergency brake. The issue is that the brake impedes the turning of the driver's seat since the lower portion of the seat will hit the brake when swiveled. 

Fortunately, there is an adapter made by Scopema that drops the emergency parking brake another couple inches lower, allowing the seat to swivel. However, some assembly is required...

Quite a bit of work, but ultimately having both seats able to swivel will allow the entire family to sit at the "dining room" once the rear bench is installed. This maximizes useable space in the van.
