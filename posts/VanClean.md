Since this was a used van (a Ford Transit 350 Extended, 2020) that had been used for cargo, the first step was to clean out the van, remove the headliner, and side liner.

The rear door hinge also needed to be replaced due to wear and tear.

Additionally, the van had suffered some damage from the prior owner, requiring that the driver's seat be reupholstered and the bottom cushion replaced.

We also needed to replace the spring in the passenger seat.
