I didn't spend a lot of time documenting our summer trips in the van, because we were living them. Overall, the van was a massive success, allowing us to go out and comfortably sleep, cook and, and camp well. We took three multi-day trips that summer and several other excursions. 

Below are a few photos highlighting our summer.

With the summer over, we were planning and dreaming about the next phase of the build and the next adventures.
