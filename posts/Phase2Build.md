After last summer (2025), we didn't do any work on the van, instead taking the the time to mentally and physically recover and consider the next steps. Our summer trips taught us that while the van was a huge improvement from sleeping in a tent, there was significant room for improvement. Namely, in the areas of sleeping width, lack of insulation, lack of a refridgerator, a way to get the toilet out of the way while minimizing odors, and reliance on the van's main lighting for inside the van. Finally, the most critical issue for the van was a lack of good storage which was exacerbated by the small garage area (due to a low bed height).

Therefore, our plan was to build the next phase in the spring of 2026 which would include the following:

1) A roof rack and solar panels to provide power to the house battery (a Goal Zero Yeti 1500x);
2) DC/DC connection from the van's alternator and battery to the house battery to charge while driving;
3) A complete electrical system that would focus primarily on DC power needs (as most of our appliances run on DC);
4) Van Flares or Capsules to widen the van in the rear sleeping area as well as allow us to raise the garage;
5) Battening to secure the walls, new kitchen, and cabinets;
6) Insulation;
7) New kitchen that would better fit the van and has storage;
8) New enclosure to store the toilet out of the way and reduce odors with vending; and,
9) Cabinets and shelves.

Once these systems are completed, hopefully by the late spring/early summer, we will hit the road for some longer trips to test them out.
