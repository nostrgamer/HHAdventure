With solar power installed, the next step was to install an alternative source of power for when the sun wasn't shining. Fortunately, our Goal Zero Yeti has a device (the Yeti Link) that allows you to plug it into your van's battery and draw power from the alternator.

The Transit's battery is installed under the driver's seat so first I had to take off the front seat and expose the battery.

The Yeti Link comes with a 80a fuse connection that connects your battery's terminals to the Anderson Pole connector that goes to the Yeti Link. I connected this to the battery terminals and then fed the wiring through the base of the driver's seat, before running a 10 foot extension back to the Goal Zero in the back of the van.

Next up was installing the Yeti Link to the Goal Zero. This involved opening the lid, taking out the screws and temporary plate cover and installing the Yeti Link in it's place. Once I powered up the Goal Zero, I used a paper clip to press the recessed button that allows you to switch from using the Yeti Link as a separate battery storage to connect it to the vehicle.

Funny story, the first time I set everything up and turned the ignition, the van wouldn't start! I thought I had messed up something with the battery and so I uninstalled all the Yeti Link to the terminal wiring. However, what I had forgot was that I'd left the lights on the van the last time it ran (it has been cloudy during the day) so the real issue was the van's battery was drained. Fortunately, a jump start and driving the van around fixed the temporarily depleted van battery. After that, I wired up everything again, reinstalled the seat and could proceed.

Finally, I could test the system. With a full battery and some usage (from the fans), the draw from the alternator would match the demand from the battery (after a brief vehicle start up phase). I then drained the house battery overnight to test how much the alternator could provide, which is about 800 watts peak. This allows us to charge a nearly empty battery to full with just a couple hours of driving (the Goal Zero holds about 150 amp hours).

With both the DC to DC charger and 350W of solar, we should have sufficient power generation for all of our van's needs, since we primarily utilize DC devices. Should we need some additional power in the future, I might consider one more brief case style solar panel (which can be installed in the spare 8mm port on the Yeti).
