Summer was coming quick and we'd seen a few days get warm in April. By early May we were looking to get the van wrapped up, but the adults needed a place to sleep.

The wife and I have always been fans of Ikea and with the massive kitchen success, we saw no reason to re-invent the wheel. Mrs. H found a great design from an engineer who had fit their Ikea frame to their van using plus nuts and steel bars.

And just like that we'd fit steel bars to the van and were then able to install the classic Ikea adjustable bed rails that would support the slats.
